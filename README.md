# EDA-Linear-regression
Exploratory Data Analysis and Salary Prediction
Overview
This project entails a thorough exploration of salary data, focusing on demographic and professional factors such as gender, age, years of experience, and education level. Additionally, it includes the development of predictive models using linear regression to forecast salaries based on these variables.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on:

Gender
Age
Salary
Years of Experience
Education Level
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover insights regarding salary distribution, gender pay disparities, and the influence of age, experience, and education on salary levels.
Utilized various visualization techniques including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation analyses to elucidate relationships among different variables.

Gender Pay Disparity:
Investigated potential salary discrepancies between genders through statistical tests and visualizations.

Age and Experience Dynamics: 
Explored the relationship between age, years of experience, and salary to identify trends and patterns in career trajectories.
Education Level Influence
Assessed the impact of education level on salary and examined the correlation between higher education and earning potential.

Predictive Modeling:
Developed linear regression models to predict salaries based on age, years of experience, and education level.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into salary dynamics and offers a predictive framework for anticipating salary trends based on demographic and professional attributes.
